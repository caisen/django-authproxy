django-authproxy
================

This is a simple authenticating proxy for Django.  It uses `gevent` to
efficiently forward ports for http connections of all types (including
websockets), but allowing you to authenticate the connection.

The use case I wrote it for: restricting access to a local etherpad server to
users who are logged into Django.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get it into your path.  This ought to work::

    pip install -e http://github.com/yourcelf/django-authproxy.git

Usage
~~~~~

Add `authproxy` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`, and then add an AUTH_PROXIES setting, for example::

    AUTH_PROXIES = ({
        'listen': ':8088', # The port on which to listen
        'backend': ':9001', # The port for the backend
        'authorize': 'myapp.auth.proveit' # auth function
    }, ...)

The `authorize` function should take a single Django `HttpRequest` object as its argument, and return True / False for whether the connection is authorized.

Start the proxy server(s) with::

    python manage.py authproxyd

Status
~~~~~~

This is brand new, not battle or production tested, and probably buggy still.
